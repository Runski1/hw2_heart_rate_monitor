## Useful stuff to know and what we gotta decide first
1. Make a clean README by the end of this course
2. Decide how we're going to manage main branch in remote repository:
At the job interview on 20. March I had this discussion with one of the
interviewers. I told that I had to spend a lot of time to fix broken master
branch when we did our first project. He said that even the smallest teams
should have one person to review the code before merging to main, and every-
thing should be published as a merge request. I'm all up for that, but it also
sounds like a bit more work, **IF everything goes smoothly when everyone just pushes straight into main.**
