## Useful stuff to know and what we gotta decide first
1. Make a clean README by the end of this course
2. Decide how we're going to manage main branch in remote repository:
    - Matias has decided that everyone is to be making merge requests.
    I suggest you make a clean clone of main branch here and use it as
    a template every time you wish to work on something. More your own
    branch diverses from main branch here, the more troublesome the merging
    is going to be.

We should try to figure out how this gitlab works together at school at some point.
